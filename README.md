## a.k.a. Rearchitector a.k.a. Infinite Nudge a.k.a. Micro Manage a.k.a. Area Actions

The name will likely become something else unless everyone comes to their senses and combines all these mods together into one mod.

HyperManage is a mod for Satisfactory, the factory building game, [Satisfactory](https://satisfactory.gamepedia.com/Satisfactory_Wiki). HyperManage allows you to adjust the position, rotation and size of objects in your factory with a suite of tools during and after placement of objects in the world.

## Installing HyperManage

It is recommended to use the Satisfactory Mod Manager (SMM) to install any mods for Satisfactory.  The SMM download and a lot of great mods are available at [ficsit.app](https://ficsit.app/).  There are quite a few broken mods there because people don't make their mods available for tohers to contribute or don't have the time, haven't updated their mod in years, etc., so you have to filter those out based on your installed version of the game.

## HyperManage Features

* Multiplayer compatible
* Move, rotate or resize items in your factory
* Movement and rotation can be relative to the player view for easy usage
* Perform operations on large groups of objects at the same time
* Undo recent HyperManage changes using Ctrl-Z
* Repeat-while-pressed functionality for adjustments, selection and undo (configurable)
* Power lines, recipes, inventories, paint color, deconstruct refund, pipette tool all preserved
* Settings and Key/Mouse configurations are customizable
* Move and rotate vehicle path nodes to fix any recording problems

## Other Features eventually added/supported

### Infinite Nudge

Removes the distance restrictions from the Nudge feature added to Vanilla in Update 8 and allows manipulation in all other ways. You enter Nudge Mode by pressing "H" (by default) while you are in Build Mode with a Hologram out.

* Nudge Vertically (Up/Down) by holding Shift and pressing the Up/Down keys.
* Nudge in smaller increments by using the Left Ctrl or Left Alt modifier keys. By default, Left Ctrl will Nudge 20cm and Left Alt will Nudge 50cm (Vanilla is 100cm). These can be done at the same time as vertical Nudge.
* Rotate the hologram by 15-degree increments while it is locked by Scrolling (Yaw), Left Shift + Scroll (Pitch), and Right Shift + Scroll (Roll). Holding Ctrl while rotating will rotate by 1-degree increments.
* Scale (resize) the hologram using the left bracket [ to shrink and the right bracket ] to grow.

All distances and amounts can be adjusted in the Mod Config and all of the hotkeys can be changed in the Vanilla Keybinds menu.

All buildings that couldn't be Nudged previously (miners, pumps, etc) can also be nudged, now.

### Area Actions

To use it, craft the Area Actions equipment in the Equipment Workshop. With it equipped, right click to open the menu. On the left side you will see the area selection and on the right the actions.

#### Area selection:
* Set corners. Click somewhere to place a corner (shown as a cylinder), click it again to remove it. This will also create some walls which define the area (note: the center of a building is used when checking if *it is inside or not)
* Set minimum height.
* Set maximum height. Minimum and maximum height can be used on multi floor factories when you only want to dismantle some floors. Click to create a plane which shows the set height, click it again to remove it.
* Clear
* Select all map
* Select a building
#### Actions:
* Mass dismantle
* Set recipe
* Set truck/train station load/unload
* Copy-Paste
* Fill
* Clear Inventories
* Eyedropper: With Area Actions equipped, middle click on a building and it open the build gun with that building selected
#### Notes:
* The corners need to be in clockwise order, otherwise you will end up with a crossing shape
* Acting on big areas takes a while
* Anything that takes 2 clicks to place is not copied, but I am working on a fix for that
* For Copy-Paste and Fill you can choose to use the build costs and if using build costs, max distance for a storage to take items from (min 0m - takes only from player, max 10km - more than the entire map)

## Contacting the Author

The easiest place to contact myself, Jusedawg, is on the [Satisfactory Modding Discord Server](https://discord.gg/TShj39G) or here on Github.  My tag over there is @Jusedawg so I'm pretty easy to find.  I prefer DMs so as to not get BS responses from the peanut gallery or idiots just wanting to give their two cents.
I would like to say that most poeple benefit from having conversations there, but if you criticize anything or ask questions as to why something isn't being updated in a reasonable time frame, the only feedback you will get is "it is being worked on", "you aren't owed anything because it's free", "any criticism or questioning anything is entitled", so history says otherwise.  If I haven't made updates in 2 years, I EXPECT people to complain, it would be weird if people didn't.

I have offered to help several times and it is mostly crickets or some BS excuses as to why something isn't or can't be updated or I just have to wait.  Appparently, the only way to get respect and have anyone listen is just to just create a mod and start duplicating their features myself.  I am mostly doing this out of necessity, not because I give two shits about the notoriety, trying to make money from it, somneone's ego, feelings or being the author of a mod and keeping it closed to myself. I literally just want to be able to play the game and move shit around after it is placed.

## HyperManage Contributors and very very similar mods

- TwoTwoEleven - MicroMange Creator/Programmer original inspiration (Nothing technically to do with this mod, but obviously this is to fill the same void that hasn't been updated in several years so giving credit where it is due)
- Scordium - Original Rearchitector Creator/Programmer (Thank you for actually posting your code to Github and trying to orginially fill the void of MicroManage not being updated)
- SirDigby - Orginal Inifinte Nudge Creator/Programmer (Thank you for trying to orginially fill the void of MicroManage not being updated among lots of other great mods )
- Mircearoata - Original Area Actions Creator/Programmer (Thank you for actually posting your code to Github as well as lots of other great mods )
- Jusedawg - Picking up the slack and putting my money where my mouth is, that gets me into trouble sometimes and hurt snowflake's feelings.  The fact that I am now making a third or fourth or fifth mod is just plain dumb though, rather than just working together on the same mod.

Anyone can contribute, complain, give feedback, whatever, I welcome it.  That is how it should be.  Modding is about the community and everyone helping to make it better.  Nobody should have to be waiting 2+ years for something to be updated because of one person and their personal life or the code not being available for anyone to contribute and help.  Nobody should be hoarding something or keeping it private when there is literally no beenfit or use of it, outside of this game.

This code will always remain open and updated.  If for some reason, I start to slack or cannot update it in a timely manner, I will have the decency and respect to the community to hand it over to someone else or anyone can freely make a copy and continue on.  All mods should be open source.  You can't do anything else with it, so what is the point, otherwise.  I just don't get the mentality  of it.
